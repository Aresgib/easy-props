/**
 * The bark mesh, in two kinds of geometry that meet out of sight.
 *
 * Heavy wood is sculpted: the blended wood field is sampled on a sparse grid
 * and turned into a surface by surface nets, then settled onto the exact field.
 * That is the only way a joint can be a true fillet; tube rings are too far
 * apart to hold one. Normals come from the field, so it shades as one piece.
 *
 * Thin wood is swept: tapered tubes of a few sides, ending in a point. A tube
 * starts inside the sculpted wood, so the change of method is never seen, and
 * a fine branch costs a few triangles instead of a very fine grid.
 *
 * Building one is split into stages, so the heavy stage can run on many threads
 * at once. `buildBark` runs them all in place.
